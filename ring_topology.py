"""
This module is dedicated to handling data from traffic-simulation.de/ring.html

A general overview goes as follows:
1. Import the dataset from the provided .txt file
2. Convert position data to x/y coordinates
3. Randomly assigns each node as honest/dishonest using ratio parameter
4. Opens animated plotly scatterplot to render the dataset
